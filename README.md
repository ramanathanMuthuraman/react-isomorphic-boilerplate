# Isomorphic React boilerplate
React JS, React-Bootstrap, React-Router, Express JS, Browserify, Browser-sync, Gulp.

With the advent of node, JavaScript tool a quantum jump. With node robotics(Cylon JS), Internet of Things(johnny-five), blah blah... almost everything became possible in JavaScript. One such happening feature is  isomorphic JavaScript. Don’t worry it’s not yet another JavaScript framework.. It’s a concept which enables server side rendering for SPA (Single Page Applications)
Most of the happening JS frameworks, gives us this option.. for instance Backbone JS was rewritten (Rendr), React already supports it, Ember too is working on it(Fast Boot)
I can hear your clamouring.. Now why this? 
Performance and SEO.. SPA has always problems with lags in initial page load and cannot serve HTML snapshot to crawlers
To implement this feature we will have to configure routers at server side instead at client side. Rest almost remains the same. 
What’s next?
