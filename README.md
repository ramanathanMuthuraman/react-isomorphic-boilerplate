# Isomorphic React boilerplate
React JS, React-Bootstrap, React-Router, Express JS, Browserify, Browser-sync, Gulp.

With the advent of node, JavaScript took a quantum jump. With node <a href="http://cylonjs.com/">robotics(Cylon JS)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five">Internet of Things(johnny-five)</a>, blah blah... almost everything became possible in JavaScript. One such happening feature is  isomorphic JavaScript. 

# What is Isomorphic JS?
Don’t worry it’s not yet another JavaScript framework.. It’s a concept which enables server side rendering for SPA (Single Page Applications). Most of the happening JS frameworks, gives us this option.. for instance Backbone JS was rewritten (<a href="http://rendrjs.github.io/"> Rendr </a>), React already supports it, Ember too is working on it(<a href="https://github.com/tildeio/ember-cli-fastboot"> Fast Boot </a>)

# Now why this?
Performance and SEO.. SPA has always problems with lags in initial page load and cannot serve HTML snapshot to crawlers
